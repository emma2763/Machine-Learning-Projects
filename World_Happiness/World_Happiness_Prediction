Instructions:

Your final report should be written up in a Jupyter notebook. It should be posted to a public Github repo as an ipynb submitted to this assignment via courseworks. Please include the link to your Github repo in this ipynb file.

You are welcome, but not required, to add any other country level features you would like to your dataset before using the data to complete your report.

Your report should include the following information:

Explore bivariate results (Use visualizations!) Describe any relationships you see between particular features and the target variable

Examine features that predict happiness categories using one or more models that allow for automatic feature selection Explain any meaningful findings

Experiment with different prediction models to try to predict World Happiness well (Fit and compare, at minimum, three models) submit three models to the model share leaderboard before you start communicating with your team.

After you submit your first three models, describe your best model with your team via your team slack channel

Fit and submit up to three more models after learning from your team.

Discuss which models you tried and which models performed better and point out relevant hyper-parameter values for successful models.

Submit your best models to the leaderboard for the World Happiness AI Model Share competition.

You have the option to present and/or discuss these models in your report, but it is not required.
